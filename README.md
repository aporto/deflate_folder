# Deflate Folder

A program that flattens all subdirectories inside a given path. It recursively moves all files from a directory tree to the parent folder, transforming the directory tree into a single directory with all files moved to the same folder

This is a Python script, but there's a Windows installer available, so you don't need to run it from Python interpreter.

All you need to do is to righ-click on a Folder, on Windows explorer, to open the folder context menu. Then select "Deflate folder", as show in the image below
